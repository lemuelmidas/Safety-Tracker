Usecase: This project, Safety Tracker, is used to track the safety of a property.

Brief Description: Safety Tracker is a blockchain-IOT safety-emergency app used to track the safety of a property(e.g a house, vehicle; ship/train/car/aeroplane, warehouse, business center, etc.) in real time. It helps cut the severity of an accident by sending help signals immediately to help/rescue centers when something wrong goes on in the vehicle/property, for quick actions. For example, for a plane that develops an issue on air, the tracker sends a warning signal and location of the plane to help centers closest to the plane or third parties to alert them of an emergency rescue. 

The location reported by the tracker will be updated for a vehicle, for as long as a vehicle's location changes to ensure the promptest safety response. However, the location of a properties with static location will not be updated, only mobile help centers around it, like fire trucks, will be updated.

Another example is for a house. The IOT tracker is set to give a real time update of accidents, like fire accident. If a fire accident occurs, a signal is sent immediately to a nearby help center and safety operations begin immediately. Resultantly, many more lives and properties can be saved with its application compared to availiable rescue systems.

Additional Note: This is a work in progress.
